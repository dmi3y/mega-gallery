# Mega Gallery

> Semantically correct gallery, now with [demo](http://dmi3y.github.io/mega-gallery/).

## Highlights

Flip like gallery that uses jQuery, SASS preprocessor and Handlebars templates under the hood. The modular approach should give enough clarity and flexibility to enable integrations, customizations, optimizations etc.
