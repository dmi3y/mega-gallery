          <div class="txt">
            Hollywood's obsession with weight is no secret. The belief that stars forgo food has become so intrinsic it's laughable. "What are you going to eat once this whole thing is over?" equally thin red carpet correspondents joke, their microphones shoved in
            the faces of Hollywood's biggest and skinniest A-list stars.

        <div class="txt">
          A young Audrey Hepburn — yes, the Audrey Hepburn — stars in a new U.K. ad for Galaxy chocolate. And the spot is admittedly evocative, certainly for Hepburn fans (myself included). It’s a beautifully shot, lush ad, set in the European countryside, full
          of bright colors and swooning romance.

      <div class="txt">
        Why doesn't this matter? Because comic book deaths never stick. I remember when Robin got killed for the first time in the '80s when everyone on the school bus was passing around a dog-eared copy of the "Death in the Family" storyline where Jason Todd
        got offed by the Joker.

    <div class="txt">
      where does this Anne Hatha-hate come from? I never quite understood it. I always thought she was quite lovely — I love The Devil Wears Prada, and the one time I ran into her in a Manhattan gay bar (she's been known to hang out with her gay brother and
      his gaggle), she was quite charming.

      Justin Bieber, would you be so kind as to shut your entitled yapper? You are an over-privileged pop star who simply didn't get his way on a day humans have deemed an occasion to celebrate their own incredible accomplishment of being pushed through a woman's
      birthing canal.
